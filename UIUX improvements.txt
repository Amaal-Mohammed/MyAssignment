Summarized UI/UX Review:
* Implement validation Message in Login page better not be done as a pop up browser 
* "Start" button should change to be "Sign in" or "Login"
* Word app.. in the app key field should be "app key"
* Lots of blank area 
* home , about, blog should be Capital : "Home, About, Blog"
* Better for Logout to be at upper right of the page
